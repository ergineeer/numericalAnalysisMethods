Functions for numerical analysis methods.

Provided function is plotted in the interval of x=[-14:5] for illustration. 

Root-Finding Algorithms
- Bracketing Methods
  - Bisection Method

Also known as Binary Chopping and Bolzano's Method, the Bisection Method is an iterative application of IVT to numerically determine roots of continuous functions. 
  - False-Position Method
- Open Methods
  - Newton-Raphson Method


Brent's Method and The Secant Method will be added soon.
